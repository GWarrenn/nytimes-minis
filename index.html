		<p style="font-size:10px"><b><sup>1</sup>Time Adjusted to Daily Average (TA-DA):</b> This number represents the average daily performance relative to the average time <i>specific to an individual day.</i>  This metric attempts to account for the variable difficulty and participation from day to day. For example, a time of 85 seconds on a Saturday (where the average time among all players was 115) may increase the average time quite a bit for one player, despite the time being very good for that day. Also, consider a player who only completes a relatively easy puzzle with a time of 45 seconds where the average time among all players was 30 for that day. If we're only comparing these two puzzles, the player who completed the easier puzzle would have a much better average time. <br><br>

		However, in this scenario, the first player would receive a <b>TA-DA</b> score of -30, while the second player would receive a <b>TA-DA</b> score of +15. These numbers are then averaged across the week/month/all time.</p>

		<p style="font-size:12px" style="font-family:Arial;" >Welcome to the inaugural season of the New York Times Mini Crossword Puzzle! Seasons will start and end every month. Inspired/stolen from the Italian professional soccer league, players are broken out into three leagues: Serie A, B, and C. For the first month, all players who completed a puzzle in the preceeding month are entered into a league based on their overall, all-time TADA score. At the end of the month, the two top players in the B and C leaues will be promoted, while the bottom players in A and B leagues will be relegated. Unlike the main leaderboard, where the TADA score is calculated from the entire field, a player's TADA score will only be calculated against other players in your league.</p>

			In late 2018, my roommate, Mika, proudly announced that she had completed a New York Times Mini crossword in under twenty seconds. I had heard of the mini crossword, but I generally prefered the full puzzle. However, the idea of a rapid fire competition piqued my interest. Over the next few days the three of us sent eachother our Mini times, trying to best eachother. Then, I created a Google sheet to track our times and slowly invited more and more people, which led to all of this.
